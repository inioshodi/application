The stock-to-flow model is a model used to measure the scarcity of resource and therein measures the ability for resource to be a ”store of value” resource. A store of value resource is one that is believed to hold its value long term, some precious metals are examples of store of value resources, for example: gold, silver and platinum.

The Stock-to-Flow model divides the available amount of a commodity, the stock by the yearly supply of said commodity, the flow, the higher the stock-to-flow ratio the more value is retained in that resource according to this model and it’s evident with Gold.

Gold is a precious metal and it is expensive to mine and as a result the yearly supply of gold is so low compared to the gold available in stock which means it’s stock-to-flow ratio is high and that in conjunction with other things makes a good case for gold to retain value over the years (which it has) and better than FIAT currency which is prone to devaluation.

Anyone familiar with bitcoin can spot the similarities with gold and bitcoin and see why there’s a case to apply this model to bitcoin. Bitcoin has been around for about 10years and it’s valued at about 11 thousand USD (about 5.1million Naira) as at the time this is being written and is projected to increase in value of the years, most of this is attributed to the fact that there is a cap on the amount of bitcoin that can be mined and a cap on the amount that can be mined yearly given that it is expensive to mine. Apparently, Bitcoin is the first ever scarce digital object.

The amount of bitcoin available is about 25times more than the amount of bitcoin mined yearly, meaning it would take 25 years the available amount to double, theoretically (bitcoin is capped at 21million). Bitcoin halving also plays an important role in increasing the stock-to-flow ratio. Bitcoin halving is when the reward given to miners for adding new transactions to the blockchain is cut in half, this reduces the yearly mined supply. Bitcoin being capped is good for the stock-to-flow model’s case because its yearly mined supply is somewhat predictable.
Everything points to bitcoin being a good store of value using the stock-to-flow model but this model has its limitations. “Models are only as strong as their assumptions”, the problem with this model is it assumes that the scarcity is the only thing that makes resources like gold valuable and it doesn’t account for other pieces of the puzzle, if all that bitcoin offers is supply scarcity, that’s a problem.

Gold is also valuable because of its liquidity, bitcoin isn’t known for it’s liquidity. Bitcoin is known for its high volatility and although that’s said to reduce eventually, high volatility is not a characteristic of a good store of value resource.

Also, People have made the point that 10 years is not a big enough dataset to use the stock-to-flow model. I think the stock-to-flow model is interesting, I think bitcoin is interesting, one should not put all his eggs in one basket.
